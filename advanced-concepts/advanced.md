# Nix CLIs

## Nix CLIs

* There's two genders of CLIs in Nix
  * `nix-*` tools vs the new `nix *` tool
* Some things are only implemented in one of the other
* The nix 2 (`nix *`) CLI is unstable!
* Generally the situation is a bit chaotic

---

## Nix CLIs (examples)

---

### Get a nix build out-link

<br/>

**1.0 nix-build**: output build output link

```console
$ nix-build -A hello
these paths will be fetched (0.04 MiB download, 0.20 MiB unpacked):
  /nix/store/8a6lbpbxbc5lc60ljwhw69sszr25ys5f-hello-2.10
copying path '/nix/store/8a6lbpbxbc5lc60ljwhw69sszr25ys5f-hello-2.10' from 'https://cache.nixos.org'...
/nix/store/8a6lbpbxbc5lc60ljwhw69sszr25ys5f-hello-2.10
```

**2.0 nix build**: create `result` symlink to output

```console
$ nix build nixpkgs.hello
$ 
```

---

### Specify `nixpkgs` path

<br/>

**1.0 nix-build**: Specify path via first parameter

```console
$ nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A hello

$ nix-build . -A hello # if pwd is in a nixpkgs checkout
```

**2.0 nix build**: Optional `-f` parameter

```console
$ nix build -f '<nixpkgs>' hello

$ nix build -f . hello # if pwd is a nixpkgs checkout
```

---

### Many many more differences

* Generally both sets of commands _need_ to be used to achieve all goals
* 1.0 commands are often preferable for scripts and automated tasks
  * Better log output
  * Stable **(!)**
* 2.0 are sometimes more convenient
  * Lack manpages and good documentation

# Overlays & overrides

---

## Overlays

* Additional package changes
* "Overlayed" onto a package set (e.g. `nixpkgs`)
* Allow for local, or organisation-wide overrides
* Implemented as a function

```nix
self: super: {
  htop = self.callPackage ./patches/htop { inherit (super) htop; };
}
```

---

### Overlay structure

* Can be a bit confusing
* Following graph from [nixos.wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays)
* I find it a bit confusing so following is a breakdown

---

### Overlay structure (1)

* Enjoy some drawings from my eInk tablet
* Situation without any overlays

![](advanced-concepts/overlays2.png)

---

### Overlay structure (2)

* Situation with a single overlay present

![](advanced-concepts/overlays3.png)

---

### Overlay structure (3)

* Same as the nixos.wiki graphic, with two overlays

<img height="550px" src="advanced-concepts/overlays4.png" />

---

## Package overrides

* Don't require an overlay!
  * Can be in-lined in your configuration
  
```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:
{
  environment.systemPackages = [
    (pkgs.git.override {
      svnSupport = true;
      sendEmailSupport = true;
    })
  ];
}
```

---

## `override` vs `overrideAttrs`

* `override` overrides attributes in a derivation
* `overrideAttrs` overrides attributes passed to `mkDerivation`

![](advanced-concepts/overrides.png)


---

## Overlay packages

* Putting this together, let's override htop

```console
$ tree patches
patches/
â””â”€â”€ htop
    â”œâ”€â”€ 0001-htop-untruncated-username.patch
    â””â”€â”€ default.nix
```

```nix
self: super: {
  htop = self.callPackage ./patches/htop { inherit (super) htop; };
}
```

---

## Overlay packages

* Don't define a new package, override parts of the existing one
* Include as many other dependencies as you need
* Then include patches, or change build steps

```nix
{ htop }:
htop.overrideAttrs ({ patches ? [], ... }: {
  patches = patches ++ [ ./0001-htop-untruncated-username.patch ];
})
```

---

## Including overlays

Two ways, depending on your setup

---

### `nixpkgs-overlays` key in `$NIX_PATH`

* Required to make `nix-shell` use overlay
* Means the overlay needs to stick around at runtime
  * --> breaks if you move it!

---

### Custom `default.nix` root

* Instead of loading `<nixpkgs>` directly, load your `default.nix`
* Then load `nixpkgs` and include the overlay
* Doesn't make `nix-shell` work!

```nix
{ overlays ? [], ... } @ args:

import <nixpkgs> (args // {
  overlays = overlays ++ [ (import ./overlay) ];
})
```

```console
$ nix build -f . htop
... # builds overlay htop
```

# Secrets ðŸ¤«

---

## Secrets and `/nix/store`

* All files in `/nix/store` are world readable
  * Not a great place to keep secrets & tokens
* Simple work-around: use strings for paths
  * Keep secrets in privileged folder in `/var/lib`
  * Reference via `"/var/lib/foo/secret"`

---

## Manual secrets

This is not ideal!

* If you move the secrets your deployment/ installation breaks!
* Files are still in plain-text: root exploit can read them out

---

## Overriding activation script

* Store secrets in your build files encrypted
* Rely on activation-time decryption by authorised user

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:
{
  system.activationScripts.setup-secrets = {
    text = ''
      ${pkgs.gnupg}/bin/gpg --decrypt ${./foo.gpg} > /var/lib/foo/secret
      # ... set the correct owner, etc
    '';
    deps = [];
  };
}
```

---

## Alternative: systemd units

* Activation scripts are complex and **must not** fail!
  * Generates one very long shell script
* If something fails, activation is in an undefined state

Instead: use systemd units! (You already know how!)

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:
{
  systemd.services.foo-secrets = {
    wantedBy = [ "foo.service" ];
    serviceConfig.user = "foo-user"; # No need to chown manually!
    script = ''
      ${pkgs.gnupg}/bin/gpg --decript ${./foo.gpg} > /var/lib/foo/secret
    '';
  };
}
```

# Extending system builds

---

## Extending system builds

* You can use `system.extraSystemBuilderCmds` to execute some code
  when building a system configuration
* For example: copy your configuration directory to the nix-store

```nix
{ ... }:
{
  system.extraSystemBuilderCmds = 
  let cfgDir = ../..;
  in
  ''
    ln -s ${lib.cleanSource cfgDir} $out/nix-config
  '';
}
```
